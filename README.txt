TO RUN: simply execute "python Play.py" from the terminal and it should comile and run nicely. 

It displays a chess board with a red team and a blue team. The blue team goes first. The pieces behave like normal chess. To see the possible moves for a piece, click on that piece and the spaces that it can move to are displayed in yellow.
It does not check for check or check mate.
